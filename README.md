# Researchers' Refuge

## General plan:
 ### Idea:
 Reddit/LinkedIn inspired website where one can log in and browse through research articles and such on main 'hot' page or 'new' etc. Can also follow other Researchers to be prompted or have their articles show up on their main page. Should also have a 'like' / 'support' system to give feedback to other researchers well written articles etc. Recommendations should also be in place for new users and in general, which would recommend researchers and/or articles according to fields of study that user is interested in or general popularity the researcher has accumulated.
